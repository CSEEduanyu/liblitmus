Overview
========
This library and the included tools provide the user-space interface to
LITMUS^RT. Real-time tasks should link against this library. The header file
"litmus.h" contains all necessary system calls and definitions to interact with
the kernel services provided for real-time tasks.

Tools
=====

* set_rt_mode {on|off}
  Enter or exit real-time mode. Real-time tasks are only scheduled by the
  kernel if the system is in real-time mode.

* showsched
  Print the name of the currently active scheduler. Schedulers are selected at
  boot time with the "rtsched=<NAME>" kernel parameter.

* rt_launch {-p <PROCESSOR>} <WCET> <PERIOD> <PROGRAM> <ARGS>...
  Launch the program <PROGRAM> as a real-time task provisioned with the given
  worst-case execution time and priod. Any additional parameters are passed on
  to the real-time task.

Install
=======
The library and the included tools  must be compiled from source. Currently,
the library and all tools are compiled by  by issuing the
command:

        $ make
